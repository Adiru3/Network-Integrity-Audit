A professional-grade network diagnostic tool designed for gamers and competitive players. Unlike standard speed tests, this audit simulates real-world gaming engine loads (128 Tick-rate) and analyzes packet stability at a granular level.

## 🛠 Key Metrics
* **Bufferbloat Delta:** Measures latency spikes under network congestion.
* **Jitter (Std Dev):** Evaluates ping consistency—crucial for games like CS2, Valorant, and Apex Legends.
* **MTU Sensitivity:** Analyzes how packet size impacts your overall delay.
* **Burst Loss Analysis:** Identifies patterns in packet loss to find hardware or ISP faults.
* **Predicted Lag:** Forecasts real-world input delay based on current jitter and RTT.

## 📊 Features
* **Real-time Charting:** Visualize your connection stability in real-time.
* **Baseline Comparison:** Save your "ideal" results to compare against future lag spikes.
* **Network Stressing:** Simulate heavy traffic to test your router's QoS/SQM performance.
* **Pro Standards Table:** Compare your results against Esports industry benchmarks.
